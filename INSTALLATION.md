## Installing the app using a Scratch Org

1. Set up your environment. Follow the steps in the [Quick Start: Lightning Web Components](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-lightning-web-components/) Trailhead project. The steps include:

   - Enable Dev Hub in your Trailhead Playground
   - Install Salesforce CLI
   - Install Visual Studio Code

2. If you haven't already done so, authorize your hub org and provide it with an alias (**myhuborg** in the command below):

   ```
   sf org login web --set-default-dev-hub --alias myhuborg
   ```

3. Clone the Survey Force repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/salesforcelabs/survey-force
   cd survey-force
   ```

4. Create a scratch org and provide it with an alias (**surveyforce** in the command below):

   ```
   sf org create scratch --set-default --definition-file config/project-scratch-def.json --alias surveyforce
   ```

5. Push the app to your scratch org:

   ```
   sf project deploy start
   ```

6. Assign the `Survey_Force_SuperAdmin` permission set to the admin user.

   ```
   sf org assign permset --name Survey_Force_SuperAdmin
   ```

7. Open the scratch org:

   ```
   sf org open
   ```

8. In App Launcher, click **View All** then select the **Survey Force** app.

## Installing the App using a Sandbox, Developer Edition Org, or a Trailhead Playground

Follow this set of instructions if you want to deploy the app to a more permanent environment than a Scratch org.
This includes non source-tracked orgs such as a [free Developer Edition Org](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) or a [Trailhead Playground](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/).

Make sure to start from a brand-new environment to avoid conflicts with previous work you may have done.

1. Authorize your Sandbox, Trailhead Playground, or Developer org and provide it with an alias (**mysurveyorg** in the command below):

   ```
   sf org login web --set-default-dev-hub --alias mysurveyorg
   ```

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/salesforcelabs/survey-force
   cd survey-force
   ```

1. If you are setting up a Developer Edition: go to **Setup**, under **My Domain**, [register a My Domain](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=domain_name_setup.htm&type=5).

1. Run this command in a terminal to deploy the app.

   ```
   sf project deploy start --target-org mysurveyorg --source-dir force-app
   ```

1. If your org isn't already open, open it now:

   ```
   sf org open --target-org mysurveyorg
   ```

1. Assign the `Survey_Force_SuperAdmin` permission set to the admin user.

   ```
   sf org assign permset --name Survey_Force_SuperAdmin
   ```

1. In App Launcher, select the **Survey Force** app.
